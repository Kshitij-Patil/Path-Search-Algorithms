# Path-Search-Algorithms

The given project implements Path Search algorithms on a weighted USA road map. 
Current implementation runs 3 Path search algorithms : Uniform Search, Greedy and Astar path search

Running the code :
 - Open the project in Visual Studio (preferably VS15)
 - Run the project "Path-Search" with the following command line arguments :
   
   path_search_algorithm start_city end_city
   
   path_search_algorithm : can be "uniform", "greedy", "astar"
   start_city : (default) calgary
   end_city : (default) elPaso
   
- You can find other city names in the "usroads.pl" file which contains all the cities connected with weighted edges data.
