# Path-Search-Algorithms

The given project does a comparative study of three Path Search algorithms : A star, Uniform(Dijkstra) and Greedy Search Algorithm. It uses usroads.pl file which contains a weighted graph with connected cities and the distance between them.

for the comparision study and conclusions, see the "PathSearchAlgorithmComparison.pdf" file.   

Running the code :
 - Run the project "Path-Search" with the following command line arguments :
   
   path_search_algorithm start_city end_city
   
   path_search_algorithm : can be "uniform", "greedy", "astar"
   start_city : calgary (default)
   end_city : elPaso (default)
   
- You can find other city names in the "usroads.pl" file which contains all the cities connected with weighted edges data.
